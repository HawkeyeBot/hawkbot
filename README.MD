# Overview
Hawkbot is a trading bot that supports trading on different exchanges and markets.

It's built with the intention of being a highly flexible framework that facilitates custom written strategies. 
The main difference between this bot and other trading bots is that it gives full control to the developer, allowing
any strategy you can think of to be created by means of a user-intuitive domain model while still allowing direct 
interaction with the core.

The bot supports running multiple symbols in 1 instance, running futures, spot and supports websockets out of the box.

For further information on how to use the bot, please refer to the [documentation](docs/index.md).
